/*
Spreading arrests within 100M of the precinct.
1. Calculate the Precinct containing each Census Block
    * Just check centroid, should be faster
        * Still slow... is index working?
2. Calculate the fraction of the total area of the precinct
   which is in the intersection of each CB and Precinct
    * Or, just the fraction of area in the CBâ€”so CBs on the edge
        round off more or less
4. Count arrests by CB
3. For CBs intersecting a 100M radius of the precinct:
    * Assign their arrest counts to the mean density
    * Spread the remainder over the entire precinct in proportion
        to the area from (2)
