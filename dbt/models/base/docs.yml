      Given 2 below, I believe "admissions" is aggregated by (program, resident zip)

      1. The data included in this presentation represent only admissions of patients to the OASAS‐certified treatment system. It is important to keep in mind that these data do not include individuals who do not enter treatment,
      get treated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), go outside of New York State for treatment, are admitted to hospitals but not to Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment, get diverted to other systems, or
      receive an addictions medication from a physician outside of the OASAS system of care.
      2. Admissions are not counts of people admitted.
      3. Some programs listed in the data table may no longer be in operation.
      4. Zip Code of Residence at Admission is the zip code reported by the client.
      5. Program level Zip Code admissions between 1 and 5 are redacted with the letter "R" for client confidentiality.

      Title: Admissions to OASAS‐certified Opioid Treatment Programs by Zip Code of Residence, Calendar Year 2017
      Date: Data Source: NYS OASAS Data Warehouse, CDS extract of 12/1/2018

      1. Admissions are not unique counts of people. A person could be admitted into treatment more than once in a given year.
      2. List includes programs that have closed.
      3. List does not include people who were admitted prior 2017 and are still in treatment.
      4. The data included in this presentation represent only admissions of patients to the OASAS‐certified treatment system. It is important to keep in mind that these
      data do not include individuals who do not enter treatment, get treated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), go outside of New York State for treatment,
      are admitted to hospitals but not to Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment, get diverted to other systems, or receive an addictions medication from a physician
      outside of the OASAS system of care.
      5. Numbers between 1 and 5 have been suppressed due to confidentiality and are represented as an 'R'.

      Title: Average Daily Enrollment in NYC OASAS‐certified Chemical Dependence Treatment Programs During CY 2010, 2015,and 2019.
      Date: 6/23/2021

      1. The data included in this presentation represent only enrollment of patients to the OASAS‐certified treatment system. It is important to keep in mind that these data do not include
      individuals who do not enter treatment, get treated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), go outside of New York State for treatment, are admitted to hospitals but not to
      Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment, get diverted to other systems, or receive an addictions medication from a physician outside of the OASAS system of care.
      2. Average Daily Enrollment (ADE) is the average annual census of OASAS‐certified treatment programs. It is not a count of unique people enrolled because a client can be in more than
      one program at the same time (e.g., Community Residential and Outpatient Treatment Program).
      3. ADE is calculated at the program level and takes into account the length of time a program was open within a given year (based on operational start and end dates).
      4. Data include Significant Others (Outpatient programs only).
      5. Current Status and Current Community District are based on the date of the data extract.
