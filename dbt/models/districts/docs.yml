      United Hospital Fund Codes, an annoying unit of geography
      used by some government agencies.

      Based on manual data entry from https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ah/zipcodetable.pdf
      and https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/appb.pdf

      Demographics are aggregated from Zip Code data, could be double-checked
      against e.g. https://www.prisonpolicy.org/origin/ny/uhf_districts.html
  - name: representatives
    description: |
      Elected officials and district boundaries for State Senate, State Assembly, House of Representatives,
      and City Council.

      Note the table explicitly excludes House districts 3 and 16 which are not really in NYC.

      Elected official names are from--? a CSV from somewhere. Seem to be current as of 2023.

      Geometries are from NYCOpenData loaded with download_opendata.py and load_geo_data.sh scripts.
      
      City Council populations are from https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/nyc-population/2020-census.page
      State Senate and Assembly populations are from PDFs linked
      from https://latfor.state.ny.us/maps/
      House of Reps. Populations were manually read off the Redistricting & You map
      at https://www.redistrictingandyou.org/?districtType=congress&tractLayer=true#map=3.5/38.5/-103
